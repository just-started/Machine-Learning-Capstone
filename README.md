# Machine-Learning-Capstone - Stock Price Predictor
The following is an exploration into using Machine Learning techniques to predict future stock prices. The final presentation is in the form of a report and web application.

## Requirements
This is currently a python 2.7 project. In the root of the repository there is a "requirements.txt" file that can be used to install all dependecies. 

The major dependecies are:
1. jupyter==1.0.0
2. Flask==0.12.2
3. matplotlib==2.0.2
4. numpy==1.13.1
5. pandas==0.20.1
6. pandas-datareader==0.5.0
7. scikit-learn==0.18.1

## Report
A full write up and analysis can be found in the projects report which is located in the "report" folder of the repository.

## Web Application
There are two ways to exlore the web application.

1. You can download the repositry and run the application yourself. The web app is in the repository folder named "www"

https://github.com/mbozelka/Machine-Learning-Capstone/tree/master/www

to run the application ensure you have all required dependecies installed (found in the requirements.txt file), cd into the "www" folder and run "python routes.py" from the command line

2. Alternatively you can view the live version currently hosted on Heroku
